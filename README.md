#Game Description
Meteor Crash is a fast-paced arcade-style game where the player must navigate a spaceship through a field of meteoroids, shooting them to survive. The objective is to
survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

#Mechanism
The player controls a spaceship using the arrow keys.The meteoroids move randomly and the player must avoid them while shooting to destroy them. 

#Design Process
This game was designed using Unity version 2021.3.22f1. The game assets were downloaded from Unity Asset Store.

#Architecture
The architecture uses Scriptable Objects to separate game data from game objects. This allows for easy modification of game parameters without changing code, resulting in greater flexibility, efficiency, and collaboration in game development.
